$ git log

$ git diff commitid1 commitid2

$ git status


$ git init // initializes a dirrectory by creating .git file
$ ls -a // to view hidden files such as .git
$ git status // gives you the current status of git repo



$ git add helloworld.txt // Adds to the staging area
$ git status // See files that are in the staging area
$ git commit -m "My first commit"
$ git log

$ git diff // Compares staging area with working dir files
$ git diff --staged // Compares recent commit with staged files
$ git diff commitid1 commitid2 // Compares two different commits


$ git branch // lists all the branches
$ git branch easy-mode // Creates a new easy mode branch
$ git checkout easy-mode // Checks out easy-mode branch

$ git log --graph --oneline master coins // Check out the commits of master and coins branches and compare both of them

$ git checkout -b branchname
The above is equivalent to 
$ git branch branchname
$ git checkout branchname


$ git merge master coins // Merge coins branch into master
$ git show commitid // Show the difference between the commid id and its parent

$ git branch -d coins // deletes the coins branch i.e deletes the lable coins but the commits are always in tact

$ git log -n 1 // Displays only the last commit


// Commands for github or remote repo

$ git remote // List of all remotes 
$ git remote -v // List of all remote names and their pointers
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/psajja/reflections.git // Create a remote repo named origin and is at the link https://....

$ git push origin master // send all the reacheable commit of the master branch to the remote origin

$ git pull origin master // To pull Changes made to the remote and add them to the local repo

$ git clone https://github.com/psajja/recipes.git // To Clone a repo on github
// Just as a side note, this will contain a remote "origin" pointing to git location for pushing changes after you made to the clone


$ git pull origin master = git fetch origin master + git merge master orgin/master

$ git fetch origin // if local repo has some changes and remote has some changes, theyn fetch will add remote changes to the local when it was last pulled by creating a branch
